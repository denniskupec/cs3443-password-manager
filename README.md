### Building
1. Requires Java 8
2. Gradle is required to fetch dependencies. 
3. Clone the repo and run: `./gradlew run`  
	- **If using Eclipse:** Run `./gradlew eclipse` or `init.bat` _before_ importing the project, 
	or you're going to have a bad time.  
	- **If using Intellij:** `./gradlew idea`
